                  <p class=MsoNormal>Any information collected by Tactical Mastery submitted by
                     the User through surveys or forms, including but not limited to email
                     addresses, whether provided by the User or acquired by Tactical Mastery as a
                     result of User correspondence, identifiable information, demographic
                     information or financial information relative to Users; and any information

                  <p class=MsoNormal>Any and all information Tactical Mastery collects can be
                     used to enhance the User’s personal experience by presenting tailored content
                     intended to be suited to the User’s individual interests. Any contact

                     information from Tactical Mastery, its partners, its affiliates, or other
                     contracted third parties. We may also utilize any information that we collect
                     from our Users to (i) perform statistical analysis, (ii) refine promotional and
                     marketing materials, (iii) produce editorial content and feedback for Tactical
                     Mastery affiliates, advertisers, and partners, (iv) strategic marketing

                  <p class=MsoNormal>To the extent that Tactical Mastery collects any User
                     information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, Tactical Mastery also
                     reserves the right to lease, license, sell, share, or otherwise disclose any
                     information collected relative to any Users with or without compensation.

                     to third parties that Tactical Mastery deems reputable at our sole discretion.
                     Notwithstanding the foregoing, by making use of the Website and/or our Online
                     Services, the User has released Tactical Mastery from damages, losses, claims,
                     and liabilities as a result of or arising from Tactical Mastery’s disclosure of
                     User information to third parties.

                  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class=MsoNormal>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Tactical
                     Mastery reserves the right to disclose any and all information relative to any

                     absolute discretion, as necessary to comply with any or all applicable laws or

                  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class=MsoNormal>To the extent that it is required by applicable law, Users
                     may request that Tactical Mastery tell Users about what personal information
                     with respect to the User that Tactical Mastery maintains. As is appropriate,
                     Users may request that Tactical Mastery correct, update, or suppress this
                     personal information, and we will make all required changes and updates within
                     the time period necessitated by any and all applicable laws. If permitted, we
                     may also charge a fee to pay for the expenses of addressing these requests. If
                     the User makes this request, Tactical Mastery may no longer be able to provide
                     said User with the quality or variety of Online Services the User expects.
